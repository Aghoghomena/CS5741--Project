Supermarket Checkout

I haven't merged this to main without checking, lets have a look at it tomorrow.

There is some issue with the last few shoppers of the day

Customer  169 is paying at Checkout  3...
Checkout 4;SCANNING;Prod.id;  6;SimScanTime;9.90;
Checkout 4;SCANNING;Prod.id; 28;SimScanTime;2.80;
Customer  175 is paying at Checkout  4...
Customer  169 is finished at Checkout  3.
Customer  175 is finished at Checkout  4.
Customer  190 arrived at Checkout  4 with  50 items
Checkout 4;SCANNING;Prod.id; 26;SimScanTime;4.80;
Customer  191 arrived at Checkout  5 with  50 items
Checkout 5;SCANNING;Prod.id; 23;SimScanTime;2.90;

The last 2 here arrive, start scanning but never finish?
